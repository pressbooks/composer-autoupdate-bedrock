# Malala

This theme is named after Malala Yousafzai, an author and activist for equal access to education, especially for girls and women. 
It is designed for academic writing and textbooks in particular. Headings are set in Raleway, and body type is set in Encode Sans 
(for the webbook and ebook exports) or EB Garamond (for PDF exports). This theme also features a "shapeshifter" feature which allows 
users to set their own header/body typefaces for webbooks, ebooks, and PDF exports separately.
